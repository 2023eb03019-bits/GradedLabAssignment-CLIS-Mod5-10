My journey to Varanasi unfolded at dawn, as the sacred Ganges shimmered under the rising sun. Pilgrims bathed in the holy waters while temple bells echoed across the ancient ghats. Narrow lanes brimmed with vibrant markets selling silk, brass idols, and fragrant street food. I watched the evening Ganga Aarti, a mesmerizing symphony of fire, chants, and devotion. That timeless city left an indelible impression on my soul.
