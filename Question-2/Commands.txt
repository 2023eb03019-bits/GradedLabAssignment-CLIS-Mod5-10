1. Shell script creation
Created the shell script log_analyzer.sh by using nano command (refer screenshot Q2-1).

2. Wrote shell script log_analyzer.sh to execute all requirements as below and made the script executable. (refer file log_analyzer.sh)
  a. Argument count check (if [ $# -ne 1 ])
  Explanation: Ensures exactly one log filename is provided; exits with usage message if not.
  b. File existence validation ([ ! -f "$logfile" ])
  Observation: Verifies the file exists before processing; prevents errors on missing paths.
  c. Readability check ([ ! -r "$logfile" ])
  Explanation: Confirms the script has read permission; avoids silent failures.
  d. Generate dated report filename (date +%Y-%m-%d)
  Observation: Creates unique report name like logsummary_2026-02-05.txt using current date.
  e. Count total entries (wc -l)
  Explanation: Uses line count as total log entries; fast and accurate.
  f. Level-specific counts (grep -c " INFO " etc.)
  Observation: grep -c counts occurrences of each log level; spaces prevent partial matches (e.g., “ERROR” vs “ERRORS”).
  g. Extract latest ERROR (grep " ERROR " | tail -1)
  Explanation: Filters ERROR lines and takes the last one (most recent) from the file.
  h. Report generation with curly‑brace group redirection
  Observation: Bundles multiple echo statements into one output block written directly to the report file.
  i. Terminal display (cat "$report_file")
  Explanation: Shows the generated report on screen for immediate verification.
  j. Graceful handling of no ERROR messages ([ -n "$latest_error" ])
  Observation: If no ERROR lines exist, prints “No ERROR messages found” instead of blank line.

3. Made the script executable using the chmod +x log_analyzer command
Observed: Script file created with execute permissions enabled.

4. Created sample log file with 20 entries.
Used cat > log.txt with heredoc to generate log entries.
Observed: File created successfully with 20 lines, mixed INFO/WARNING/ERROR levels, correct date format.

5. Ran script with valid log file
Executed ./log_analyzer.sh log.txt.
Observed: Generated logsummary_2026-02-05.txt report showing correct statistics and displayed latest ERROR line. (refer screenshot Q2-2 or file logsummary_2026-02-05.txt)

6. Tested errors handling:
Test case 1: ./log_analyzer.sh (no argument)
Observed: Script printed "Error: Log file name required" with usage example and exited gracefully. (refer screenshot Q2-3)

Test case 2: ./log_analyzer.sh nonexistent.log (non‑existent file)
Observed: Script displayed "Error: File 'nonexistent.log' does not exist." and exited cleanly. (refer screenshot Q2-4)

Test case 3: chmod 000 log.txt && ./log_analyzer.sh log.txt (unreadable file)
Observed: Script output "Error: File 'log.txt' is not readable." and exited without crashing. (refer screenshot Q2-5)
