1. Shell script creation
Created the shell script log_analyzer.sh by using nano command (refer screenshot Q2-1).

2. Wrote a script that can handle all requirements. (refer file log_analyzer.sh)

3. Made the script executable using the chmod +x log_analyzer command
Observed: Script file created with execute permissions enabled.

4. Created sample log file with 20 entries.
Used cat > log.txt with heredoc to generate log entries.
Observed: File created successfully with 20 lines, mixed INFO/WARNING/ERROR levels, correct date format.

5. Ran script with valid log file
Executed ./log_analyzer.sh log.txt.
Observed: Generated logsummary_2026-02-05.txt report showing correct statistics and displayed latest ERROR line. (refer screenshot Q2-2 or file logsummary_2026-02-05.txt)

6. Tested errors handling:
Test case 1: ./log_analyzer.sh (no argument)
Observed: Script printed "Error: Log file name required" with usage example and exited gracefully. (refer screenshot Q2-3)

Test case 2: ./log_analyzer.sh nonexistent.log (non‑existent file)
Observed: Script displayed "Error: File 'nonexistent.log' does not exist." and exited cleanly. (refer screenshot Q2-4)

Test case 3: chmod 000 log.txt && ./log_analyzer.sh log.txt (unreadable file)
Observed: Script output "Error: File 'log.txt' is not readable." and exited without crashing. (refer screenshot Q2-5)
