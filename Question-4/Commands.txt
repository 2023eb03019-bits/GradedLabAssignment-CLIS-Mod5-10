1. Created sample data file emails.txt with cat > emails.txt (refer file emails.txt or screenshot Q4-1)
  Observed: File created with 18 lines of valid and invalid email addresses.

2. Wrote shell script emailcleaner.sh to execute as below and made the script executable. (refer file emailcleaner.sh)
  a. File existence check (if [ ! -f "emails.txt" ])
  Explanation: Verifies input file exists before processing to avoid runtime errors.
  b. Clearing output files (> valid.txt, > invalid.txt)
  Observation: Ensures clean slate by truncating/creating empty output files.
  c. Define regex pattern (VALID_PATTERN='^[a-zA-Z0-9]\+@[a-zA-Z]\+\.com$')
  Explanation: Pattern matches only letters/digits before @, only letters after @, and exactly .com TLD.
  d. Extract valid emails (grep -x "$VALID_PATTERN")
  Observation: -x ensures whole‑line matches; output piped to sort -u removes duplicates automatically.
  e. Extract invalid emails (grep -v -x "$VALID_PATTERN")
  Explanation: -v inverts match, capturing all lines that don’t fit the valid pattern.
  f. Count results (wc -l < valid.txt)
  Observation: Uses input redirection to get line counts without filenames in output.
  g. Summary echo statements
  Explanation: Displays clean summary of valid/invalid counts and confirms deduplication.

3. Ran script with ./emailcleaner.sh
  Observed: Output correctly displayed with proper email cleaning summary. (refer screenshot Q4-2)
  Observed: Generated valid.txt with unique and valid email addresses and generated invalid.txt containing all invalid email addresses. (refer screenshot Q4-3 or refer files valid.txt and invalid.txt)
