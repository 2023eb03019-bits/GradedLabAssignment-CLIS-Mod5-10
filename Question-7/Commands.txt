1. Used the same input file (input.txt) that was used in Question 6.

2. Wrote shell script patterns.sh to execute as below and made the script executable. (refer file patterns.sh)
  a. Argument validation (if [ $# -ne 1 ])
  Explanation: Ensures exactly one text filename is provided; shows usage on error.
  b. File existence and readability checks
  Observation: Validates that the input file exists and can be read before processing.
  c. Clearing output files (> vowels.txt etc.)
  Explanation: Creates empty output files or truncates existing ones to start fresh.
  d. Tokenization pipeline (tr -s '[:space:]' '\n')
  Observation: Converts spaces/tabs to newlines, making one word per line; removes punctuation and blank lines.
  e. Lowercase conversion (tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
  Explanation: Ensures case‑insensitive matching as required.
  f. Vowel‑only test (tr -d 'aeiou' and [ -z ... ])
  Observation: If deleting all vowels leaves an empty string, the word contains only vowels.
  g. Consonant‑only test (tr -d 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz')
  Explanation: If deleting all consonants leaves empty, the word contains only consonants.
  h. First‑character check (cut -c1 and =~ [aeiou])
  Observation: Uses regex to test if first character is a vowel; if not, word starts with consonant.
  i. Categorization with continue
  Explanation: Once a word is classified (vowel‑only or consonant‑only), skips further checks.
  j. Summary with wc -l counts
  Explanation: Shows how many words landed in each category for quick verification.

3. Ran script with ./patterns.sh input.txt
  Observed: Pattern analysys completed successfully.
  Generated output files as follows:
  Words with only vowels in vowels.txt
  Words with only consonants in consonants.txt
  Words that are mixed in mixed.txt
  (refer screenshot Q7-1)
