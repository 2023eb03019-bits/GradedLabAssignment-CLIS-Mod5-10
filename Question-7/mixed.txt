journey
to
Varanasi
dawn
the
sacred
Ganges
shimmered
the
rising
sun
Pilgrims
bathed
the
holy
waters
while
temple
bells
the
ghats
Narrow
lanes
brimmed
with
vibrant
markets
selling
silk
brass
fragrant
street
food
watched
the
Ganga
mesmerizing
symphony
fire
chants
devotion
That
timeless
city
left
soul
